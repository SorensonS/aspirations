<hr>
<p>I am not overly content with my current situation in life. I have wasted a lot of time over the past decade and more instead of working towards achieving my goals. I aim to better my life by establishing some goals alongside plans and methods to instill productive living habits. </p>
<p>I will briefly outline the direction I would like to see my life go and some inspirations to refer to when needed.</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>I would like to become a well round pianist with a focus on contempory classical music. I also aim to become effecient in the art of music production using DAWs. Sound design is also a skill I would like to become familiar with. I have a included some links to some musical material that inspires my learning. <br>

</li>
<br>
<li>I would like to become somewhat finacially free, not that there really is such a thing. I just don't want to be trapped in a job for 40hrs a week. I would the freedom and flexibilty to travel. I have been working towards this goal as far as the finacial side goes however; I need to start working towards more career options and making my self more attractable to the market place</li>
<br>
<li>I would like to be able to pursue my outdoor hobbies such as; mountain biking, hiking, kayaking and many more. Realistically Melbourne is not the ideal location for this. Longterm I will research other living locations that are more suited and hopefully have a skill set where I can gain employment in this area. Having a strong finances will surely help this vision.</li>
</ul>
